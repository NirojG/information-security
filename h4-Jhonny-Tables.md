## Summary of OWASP 10: 2021
- OWASP stands for Open Worldwide Application Security Project. It is an open community, it is free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.
- The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security.  It represents the most critical security risks to web applications.
- Globally recognized by developers as the first step towards more secure coding.
- It has top 10 lists of most critical web security risks starting from the most serious ones leading to the 10th place of the most critical web security risks. 

### A01: 2021 - Broken Access Control 
- This is the no 1. serious web application security risks in the OWASP 10:2021. 
- Accessing the data or functions beyond their permissions.
- It includes bypassing the access checks by tampering the URLs, internatl states or API requests.
- Acting as administrators and or access other user's account by manipulating metadata such as JWT.

### A05: 2021 - Security Misconfiguration

- systems or cloud services set up incorrectly or improperly which creates vulnerability in the system.
- Unnecessary features are installed or enable that might compromise the system security like unnecessary ports, accounts, privileges etc.
- While upgrading system, the latest security features maybe disabled or not configured securely.
- The software of the systems or services is out of date or missing an update making it vulnerable.
- Default accounts of the system and their passwords are still the same and unchanged meaning they haven't been modified or made secure passwords.

### A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- This risk involves using software libraries or frameworks that have known security holes.
- It covers everything from the operating system and database to nested dependencies.
- You are at risk if you don't have a full inventory of the component versions you use.
- Prevention requires a patch management process to remove unused code and update libraries regularly.

### A03:2021 - Injection 
- This risk occurs when hostile data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.
- It commonly includes SQL, NoSQL, OS command, and LDAP injections.
- Applications are vulnerable when the user-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized.
- The best prevention method for injection is using secure, parameterized APIs or Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools.

### Exploits of Mom
- I found this funny as this is a classic comical example of a malicious attack/ instruction to school system.
- They son's name being associated with DROP TABLE Students; actually instructs the database to drop the entire table of students from database records.
- There is also a good moral of the story kind of vibes given in the funny story where they are made aware of a critical security risks.
